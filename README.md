# Python-Project WebBrowser
Simple Web Browser application with the ability to save custom bookmarks to a .txt file
App and requirements are made for Python 3.10.9

# Installation
1. Install Python 3 and PIP
2. Get this repo
3. Go inside the repo and install the requirements using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Files
main.py - main script used for executing<br/>
MyWidgets.py - script storing the Browser class, handling web navigation<br/>
bookmarks.py - script containing bookmark class that loads bookmarks from .txt file and can add additional bookmarks and save it back to the file<br/>

# Ideas for improvement
I have noticed some "glitches" while working with the browser, but i have not yet found a way to fix them(e.g. seznam.cz articles sometimes cannot be opened other than by middle mouse button)<br/>
- Add support for multiple tabs
- Add browsing history
- Add Themes(dark, light, custom background, etc.)

this readme was brought to you by my colleague, because i ripped off most of his syntax
